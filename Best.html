    <p>At Oak Park and River Forest High School I learned a lot of helpful tools that will help me greatly in the future. Here are some of my favorite classes that helped greatly in aquiring these tools.</p>
           
    <h1>AP Computer Sciences A</h1>
    <p>Computer Sciences was one of my favorite classes in high school. I took it during sophtmore year 2017-2018 and I learned a lot about coding in Java. At this time I already had been programming in javascript for a few years which made it confusing learing some of the slighty different subtlties of Java; however, I feel like this made me a better coder and learner by the end of the year.</p>
    
    <h1>Computer Applications</h1>
    <p>Although I only took this class to get my keyboarding credit, I was delightfully suprsided by the magnitude of things I actually learned in this class. From Word and Excel certifications to resumes and the online portfolio you are reading right now I learned a variety of important real life skills in this class.</p>
